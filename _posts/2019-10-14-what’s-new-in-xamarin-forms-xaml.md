## XAML Regions

Without a doubt this characteristic fascinates me, in C # it is good practice to separate important parts, contract them or expand them is something that a simple comment does not do, with “XAML Regions” we can reorganize our code and add good practices in the process.

## Go To Definition

This option allows you to go directly to an object, it is great to locate styles, binding, etc, that we are using.
